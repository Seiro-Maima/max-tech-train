<!-- The counter page requires a page with two buttons and an input control. 
    One button shows "MINUS" and the other shows "PLUS". The input control 
    displays a number that starts at zero. If the "PLUS" button is clicked, 
    the number in the input control is increased by 1. If the "MINUS" button 
    is clicked, the number decreases by 1. The number can go negative.
​
    After this is done, you can choose to enhance this application with this 
    functionality. The number in the input control should be styled using these rules:
​    * If the number is evenly divisibly by 2, display the number in red otherwise display in black.​
    * If the number is evenly divisibly by 3, display the number in bold otherwise display normally.
    * If the number is evenly divisibly by 5, display the number in italic otherwise display normally.
​
    Here is how you can use jQuery to style. Get programmatic access to the input control and call 
    the jQuery `css()` method. The CSS method takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is the style 
    to change (i.e. fontFamily) and the second parameter is the value to change it to (i.e. "Arial") 
    so here is an example:
​
    `ctrl.css("fontFamily", "Arial")`
    
    Best of luck for trying to do this. -->
